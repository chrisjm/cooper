# Contributing

Having trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/chrisjm/cooper/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/chrisjm/cooper/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

Cooper has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your site's unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `feature/awesome-feature` or `bug/fix-broken-thing`).
3. Open a pull request on GitHub and describe the feature or fix.

Theme documentation and demo pages can be found in the [`../docs`](docs) if submitting improvements, typo corrections, etc.
